module.exports = {
  token: "xxx", // discord bot token
  prefix: "!", // default bot prefix
  mongoDB: "mongoURL", // mongodb connection string
  dbOptions: { // object containing the mongodb connection options
    "useNewUrlParser": true,
    "useUnifiedTopology": true,
    "useCreateIndex": true,
    "useFindAndModify": false
  },
  support: { // some ids for servers and channels
    id: "", // the id of your support server, if you have one
    logs: "", // the id of the channel where you want join and leave logs to be sent
  },
  embed: {
    color: "#0091fc", // default embed colour
    footer: "ComfyBot | DistroByte#0001", // default embed footer
  },
  owner: {
    id: "", // your user id
    name: "", // your username/display name
  },
  apiKeys: {
    amethyste: "", // amethyste API key for some image commands
  },
  emojis: {}, // an object of all the emojis you may want to use

};
```
